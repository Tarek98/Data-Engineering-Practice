- 5h ⌛ 2̶h̶ 4h : ✅ Get WordCount scala sample to work locally & understand how it works E2E.
    - Needs to work locally, instead of hadoop cluster it was originally designed to run on.
    - Got it working with Scala Metals + SBT at word-count-test folder :-)


- 15m ⌛ 15m : ✅ Ensure local debugging & running of work's codebase still works.
- 2h ⌛ 30m : ✅ Play around with word count app a bit more 
& utilization of local cores as spark workers.
