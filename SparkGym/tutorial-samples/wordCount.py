    #   -> This pause method should only be used for local testing env
    #      --> Why: In a production env, having multiple idle SparkContexts stalling can be troublesome?
    #   -> What you should do in production or expensive envs:
    #      --> Investigate long running jobs using their Web UI during execution.
    #      --> Use SHS (Spark History Server) to reconstruct a past UI, provided that the applicationâ€™s event logs exist.
